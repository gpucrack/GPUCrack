# CUDA_naive_exhaustive_search
Parallelized naive exhaustive search with CUDA. Contains a parallelized hash too.

## To-do list

- [ ] Functional code using the GPU
- [ ] Hash all passwords to simulate real use
- [ ] Graphical interface
- [ ] Find the sweet spot to use the GPU as max as possible
- [ ] Code optimisation
- [ ] Full code comment
